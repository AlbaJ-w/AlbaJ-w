### Hi there, I'm Alba! ðŸ‘‹

I have always been a curious person, ever since I was a child. I have always been fascinated by topics such as astronomy and scientific subjects, as well as the poetry behind the humanistic ones. I have always wondered what was behind everything: when I chose the university, I opted for a humanistic field, completing a Master's Degree in Cinema and Digital Arts.

I then decided to specialize further with a Master in Computer Graphics, finally discovering the technical magic behind the world of videogames and cinema.

I then decided to expand my knowledge by taking a programming course: Iâ€™ve always being passionate about videogames and I wanted to combine my skills as a 3D Artist with coding, in order to bring together my passion for more artistic fields - such as 3D graphics - to the more technical and scientific ones - such as programming.

I recently finished a course as a Junior DotNet Developer at Generation and I have just started the Microsoft Academy for Girls at Avanade. My goal for the future is to work in a software house that deals with videogame development, in order to bring together my passions and skills!
